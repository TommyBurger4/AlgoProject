    "Since the 90s, there has been a truly global awareness of the need to reduce energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. The first commitments emerged when the Kyoto Protocol was signed in 1997. However, this protocol only entered into force in 2005, and many scientists believed that the efforts to slow down global warming were not enough. Since then, other more ambitious commitments have seen the light of day (France’s commitment to a 75 % reduction in emissions by 2050, for example, commitments made by certain large cities such as Paris). But the task is complicated. The government and local authorities are unable to force companies and individuals to change their habits in order to meet these goals. Therefore, action is primarily focused on changing behaviour. Saving and recycling raw materials, improving means of transport and the energy performance of buildings should become priorities.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Constraints that do not change the space for solutions, only their values. For example, by taking into account time slots where waiting is required (if the truck is ahead of schedule). In the case of a neighbourhood-based method, the neighbours of a solution will not be changed by incorporating this constraint, only the costs will be different.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Constraints that change the space for solutions. For example, some items that require a specific type of truck for being delivered. Adding this constraint will render some solutions invalid, and consequently limit the space for solutions. </br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the basic constraints \"Constant travel time\" and \"Single depot\" are mandatory, they define the weights on the graph and the starting point. Without them, it would simply become a Hamiltonian cycle problem. Here we have a Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) with an initial depot.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "<center><img src=\"assets/cons.png\" alt=\"constraints\" width=\"500\" height=\"200\"></center> </br>\n",
    "\n",
    "For time windows, we chose this constraint because it introduces a realistic scheduling aspect to the problem without changing the underlying network structure. Each delivery point must be visited within a specific time interval, which reflects real-world conditions such as customer availability, store opening hours, or access restrictions in certain zones. Unlike the basic version where no delivery is allowed outside the time slot, the advanced version allows waiting before the opening of the time window. This makes the model more flexible and operationally realistic: a truck arriving early can wait rather than having to modify its entire route. This type of modeling better represents real delivery practices while maintaining algorithmic feasibility. It mainly impacts the cost evaluation of a route rather than the structure of the search space.\n",
    "\n",
    "For heterogeneous fleets, we chose the basic version, which assumes the use of k identical trucks. This simplifies the problem while still reflecting realistic multi-vehicle operations. The focus remains on the coordination of several vehicles rather than their individual characteristics. This version allows us to analyze the algorithm’s performance on multi-truck configurations. \n",
    "\n",
    "By combining these constraints, our approach aims to move beyond purely theoretical optimization and develop a decision-support tool applicable to real-world logistics. This approach will enable ADEME to assess the environmental and operational impact of optimized routing strategies in diverse mobility contexts.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address this complex problem, we will implement a Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (VRPTW). The VRPTW is an extension of the classical Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP). It consists in determining the optimal set of routes for a fleet of vehicles to deliver goods to a set of customers, starting and ending at one or several depots, while minimizing total travel time or distance.\n",

    "The delivery route optimization problem addressed in this project belongs to the family of combinatorial optimization problems in the field of Operations Research. It aims to determine the most efficient way to connect a set of delivery points while minimizing total travel cost or time. So, there are two suitable methods for this problem: TSP (Travelling Salesman Problem) and VRP (Vehicle Routing Problem).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Description:** The Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) represents the simplest form of route optimization. It involves a single vehicle (or salesman) that must visit each city exactly once and return to the starting point, while minimizing the total distance or travel time. Mathematically, it can be expressed as a graph optimization problem where cities are nodes and the distances between them are weighted edges. Despite its simple formulation, TSP is known to be NP-hard, meaning that the computational time grows exponentially with the number of cities.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition:** The Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) is an extension of the TSP. Instead of a single route, it considers multiple vehicles that must serve multiple customers from one or more depots. Additional constraints are typically included, such as vehicle capacity limits, delivery time windows, or maximum route duration. The VRP better reflects real-world logistics operations and is therefore a more general and complex model. Like TSP, VRP is also NP-hard, but with an even higher computational complexity due to the presence of multiple vehicles and constraints.\n",

    "**Main characteristics:**\n",
    "- Multiple vehicles / multiple routes.\n",

    "  - Multi-depot\n",
    "- Objective: overall optimization of the delivery system.\n",

    "- CVRP – Capacitated VRP (with load limit)\n",
    "- VRPTW – VRP with Time Windows (time limit)\n",
    "- MDVRP – Multi-Depot VRP (multiple warehouses)\n",
    "- Dynamic VRP – VRP with real-time elements (changing traffic, new orders, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, both TSP and VRP provide strong theoretical foundations for delivery route optimization. TSP offers a simple and well-studied model for understanding the core principles of route planning, while VRP provides a more realistic representation of modern logistics systems. The choice between these two models depends on the scope of the project: TSP is suitable for single-vehicle scenarios, whereas VRP is more appropriate for multi-vehicle or large-scale delivery networks.\n",

    "\n",
    "   - It is a higher-level procedure or heuristic designed to find, generate, tune, or select a heuristic (partial search algorithm) that may provide a sufficiently good solution to an optimization problem or a machine learning problem, especially with incomplete or imperfect information or limited computation capacity.\n",
    "   - It balances intensification (deep search near good solutions) and diversification (broad search to escape local optima), with limited problem‑specific assumptions.\n",

    "   A  meta‑heuristic designs a trajectory :\n",

    "   under rules that combine deterministic and stochastic moves, adaptive memory, and acceptance criteria, to reach high‑quality solutions under time/effort constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Core Caracteristics**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Problem‑independent scaffolding with problem‑specific components (solution encoding, neighborhood, evaluation).\n",
    "   - Emphasis on incomplete, anytime computation: can stop early and return the best‑so‑far.\n",
    "   - Mechanisms to avoid premature convergence: randomness, memory, perturbations, acceptance of non‑improving moves.\n",
    "   - Parameterization enabling control of search behavior (temperature schedules, tabu tenures, mutation rates, etc.).\n",

    "- Tabu Search is a meta‑heuristic that performs iterative local search while using adaptive memory (“tabu list”) to forbid or penalize recently made moves or attributes, preventing cycling and encouraging exploration beyond local optima.\n",
    "- At iteration t, from current solution x^(t), it examines a neighborhood N(x^(t)), chooses the best admissible move (possibly non‑improving), applies it to get x^(t+1), and updates memory. Aspiration criteria may override tabu status when a move leads to a sufficiently good solution."
