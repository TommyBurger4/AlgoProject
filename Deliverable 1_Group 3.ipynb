    "Since the 90s, there has been a truly global awareness of the need to reduce energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. The first commitments emerged when the Kyoto Protocol was signed in 1997. However, this protocol only entered into force in 2005, and many scientists believed that the efforts to slow down global warming were not enough. Since then, other more ambitious commitments have seen the light of day (France’s commitment to a 75 % reduction in emissions by 2050, for example, commitments made by certain large cities such as Paris). But the task is complicated. The government and local authorities are unable to force companies and individuals to change their habits in order to meet these goals. Therefore, action is primarily focused on changing behaviour. Saving and recycling raw materials, improving means of transport and the energy performance of buildings should become priorities.\n",

    "<center><img src=\"assets/constraints.png\" alt=\"constraints\" width=\"500\" height=\"200\"></center> </br>\n",
    "\n",
    "These constraints can be divided into two categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Constraints that do not change the space for solutions, only their values. For example, by taking into account time slots where waiting is required (if the truck is ahead of schedule). In the case of a neighbourhood-based method, the neighbours of a solution will not be changed by incorporating this constraint, only the costs will be different.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Constraints that change the space for solutions. For example, some items that require a specific type of truck for being delivered. Adding this constraint will render some solutions invalid, and consequently limit the space for solutions. </br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the basic constraints \"Constant travel time\" and \"Single depot\" are mandatory, they define the weights on the graph and the starting point. Without them, it would simply become a Hamiltonian cycle problem. Here we have a Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) with an initial depot.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result we decided to incorporate the following constraints into our project: **Time windows (advanced version)**, **Heterogeneous fleet (basic version)**, **Dynamic traffic (basic version)** and **Pickup points (basic version)**:\n",
    "\n",
    "<center><img src=\"assets/cons.png\" alt=\"constraints\" width=\"500\" height=\"200\"></center> </br>\n",
    "\n",
    "For time windows, we chose this constraint because it introduces a realistic scheduling aspect to the problem without changing the underlying network structure. Each delivery point must be visited within a specific time interval, which reflects real-world conditions such as customer availability, store opening hours, or access restrictions in certain zones. Unlike the basic version where no delivery is allowed outside the time slot, the advanced version allows waiting before the opening of the time window. This makes the model more flexible and operationally realistic: a truck arriving early can wait rather than having to modify its entire route. This type of modeling better represents real delivery practices while maintaining algorithmic feasibility. It mainly impacts the cost evaluation of a route rather than the structure of the search space.\n",
    "\n",
    "For heterogeneous fleets, we chose the basic version, which assumes the use of k identical trucks. This simplifies the problem while still reflecting realistic multi-vehicle operations. The focus remains on the coordination of several vehicles rather than their individual characteristics. This version allows us to analyze the algorithm’s performance on multi-truck configurations. \n",
    "\n",
    "By combining these constraints, our approach aims to move beyond purely theoretical optimization and develop a decision-support tool applicable to real-world logistics. This approach will enable ADEME to assess the environmental and operational impact of optimized routing strategies in diverse mobility contexts.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address this complex problem, we will implement a Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (VRPTW). The VRPTW is an extension of the classical Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP). It consists in determining the optimal set of routes for a fleet of vehicles to deliver goods to a set of customers, starting and ending at one or several depots, while minimizing total travel time or distance.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Description:** The Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) represents the simplest form of route optimization. It involves a single vehicle (or salesman) that must visit each city exactly once and return to the starting point, while minimizing the total distance or travel time. Mathematically, it can be expressed as a graph optimization problem where cities are nodes and the distances between them are weighted edges. Despite its simple formulation, TSP is known to be NP-hard, meaning that the computational time grows exponentially with the number of cities.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition:** The Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) is an extension of the TSP. Instead of a single route, it considers multiple vehicles that must serve multiple customers from one or more depots. Additional constraints are typically included, such as vehicle capacity limits, delivery time windows, or maximum route duration. The VRP better reflects real-world logistics operations and is therefore a more general and complex model. Like TSP, VRP is also NP-hard, but with an even higher computational complexity due to the presence of multiple vehicles and constraints.\n",

    "**Main characteristics:**\n",
    "- Multiple vehicles / multiple routes.\n",

    "  - Time window constraint\n",
    "  - Multi-depot\n",
    "- Objective: overall optimization of the delivery system.\n",

    "- CVRP – Capacitated VRP (with load limit)\n",
    "- VRPTW – VRP with Time Windows (time limit)\n",
    "- MDVRP – Multi-Depot VRP (multiple warehouses)\n",
    "- Dynamic VRP – VRP with real-time elements (changing traffic, new orders, etc.)\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, both TSP and VRP provide strong theoretical foundations for delivery route optimization. TSP offers a simple and well-studied model for understanding the core principles of route planning, while VRP provides a more realistic representation of modern logistics systems. The choice between these two models depends on the scope of the project: TSP is suitable for single-vehicle scenarios, whereas VRP is more appropriate for multi-vehicle or large-scale delivery networks.\n",

    "The *Traveling Salesman Problem with Time Windows* (TSPTW) extends the classical Traveling Salesman Problem by adding a set of time constraints within which each city must be visited. The presence of time windows transforms the problem from strictly routing to a scheduling problem that must respect temporal feasibility alongside route optimization. This combination makes TSPTW a more realistic and practical model for delivery and logistics problems where timing is critical.\n",

Given a proposed route, one can verify that it visits each city exactly once, respects the time window constraints by checking arrival times against $[a_i, b_i]$, and calculates the total travel time to confirm it does not exceed $k$. Since these verifications involve simple arithmetic and sequence checking over $n$ cities, they can be performed in polynomial time relative to $n$.\n",

Assign time windows to all cities as $[0,K]$, with $K$ large enough so they do not constrain routing. Set the maximum allowed travel time $k = n$. Thus, a route of total travel time $≤ k$ exists if and only if there is a Hamiltonian cycle in the original graph $G$. This polynomial-time reduction shows that TSPTW is at least as hard as the Hamiltonian Cycle problem, proving TSPTW is NP-hard.\n",
