    "Since the 90s, there has been a truly global awareness of the need to reduce energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. The first commitments emerged when the Kyoto Protocol was signed in 1997. However, this protocol only entered into force in 2005, and many scientists believed that the efforts to slow down global warming were not enough. Since then, other more ambitious commitments have seen the light of day (France’s commitment to a 75 % reduction in emissions by 2050, for example, commitments made by certain large cities such as Paris). But the task is complicated. The government and local authorities are unable to force companies and individuals to change their habits in order to meet these goals. Therefore, action is primarily focused on changing behaviour. Saving and recycling raw materials, improving means of transport and the energy performance of buildings should become priorities.\n",

Each delivery point must be visited within a specific time interval, which reflects real-world conditions such as customer availability, store opening hours, or access restrictions in certain zones. This constraint affects only the timing of visits, not the possible connections between points. It adds a layer of temporal coordination to the optimization, making the resulting routes both feasible and more representative of actual delivery operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "For dynamic traffic, we chose it because it makes the model much more realistic without fundamentally changing the graph’s structure. Instead of having fixed travel times, each road segment now has a time-dependent duration that reflects real variations in traffic throughout the day (rush hours, congestion, etc.). This means that the cost of a route depends on the departure time from each point, making the optimization closer to real delivery conditions. While this adds some computational complexity, it provides a more accurate and environmentally relevant model by helping avoid peak traffic periods and reduce fuel consumption.\n",

  "# Theoretical justification\n",
  "\n",
  "The delivery route optimization problem addressed in this project belongs to the family of combinatorial optimization problems in the field of Operations Research. It aims to determine the most efficient way to connect a set of delivery points while minimizing total travel cost or time. So, there are two suitable methods for this problem: TSP (Travelling Salesman Problem) and VRP (Vehicle Routing Problem).\n",
  "\n",
  "## Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP)\n",
  "\n",
  "**Description:** The Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) represents the simplest form of route optimization. It involves a single vehicle (or salesman) that must visit each city exactly once and return to the starting point, while minimizing the total distance or travel time. Mathematically, it can be expressed as a graph optimization problem where cities are nodes and the distances between them are weighted edges. Despite its simple formulation, TSP is known to be NP-hard, meaning that the computational time grows exponentially with the number of cities.\n",
  "\n",
  "**Main characteristics:**\n",
  "- Only one person / one vehicle.\n",
  "- No limits on load or delivery time.\n",
  "- All cities must be visited once.\n",
  "- Single goal: minimize total cost or distance.\n",
  "\n",
  "**Function:** Each city is visited only once, and the route is a closed loop.\n",
  "\n",
  "## Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP)\n",
  "\n",
  "**Definition:** The Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) is an extension of the TSP. Instead of a single route, it considers multiple vehicles that must serve multiple customers from one or more depots. Additional constraints are typically included, such as vehicle capacity limits, delivery time windows, or maximum route duration. The VRP better reflects real-world logistics operations and is therefore a more general and complex model. Like TSP, VRP is also NP-hard, but with an even higher computational complexity due to the presence of multiple vehicles and constraints.\n",
  "\n",
  "**Main characteristics:**\n",
  "- Multiple vehicles / multiple routes.\n",
  "- Possible additional constraints such as:\n",
  "  - Capacity constraint\n",
  "  - Time window constraint\n",
  "  - Multi-depot\n",
  "- Objective: overall optimization of the delivery system.\n",
  "\n",
  "**Common variations:**\n",
  "- CVRP – Capacitated VRP (with load limit)\n",
  "- VRPTW – VRP with Time Windows (time limit)\n",
  "- MDVRP – Multi-Depot VRP (multiple warehouses)\n",
  "- Dynamic VRP – VRP with real-time elements (changing traffic, new orders, etc.)\n",
  "\n",
  "## Conclusion\n",
  "\n",
  "In summary, both TSP and VRP provide strong theoretical foundations for delivery route optimization. TSP offers a simple and well-studied model for understanding the core principles of route planning, while VRP provides a more realistic representation of modern logistics systems. The choice between these two models depends on the scope of the project: TSP is suitable for single-vehicle scenarios, whereas VRP is more appropriate for multi-vehicle or large-scale delivery networks.\n"

    "The *Traveling Salesman Problem with Time Windows* (TSPTW) extends the classical Traveling Salesman Problem by adding a set of time constraints within which each city must be visited. The presence of time windows transforms the problem from strictly routing to a scheduling problem that must respect temporal feasibility alongside route optimization. This combination makes TSPTW a more realistic and practical model for delivery and logistics problems where timing is critical.\n",

    "The decision version of the TSPTW can be verified in polynomial time. Given a proposed route, one can verify that it visits each city exactly once, respects the time window constraints by checking arrival times against $[a_i, b_i]$, and calculates the total travel time to confirm it does not exceed $k$. Since these verifications involve simple arithmetic and sequence checking over $n$ cities, they can be performed in polynomial time relative to $n$.\n",

Given a graph $G=(V,E)$ for the Hamiltonian Cycle problem, construct a complete graph $G'=(V,E')$ for TSPTW where edges in $E$ have travel time 1, and edges not in $E$ have a large travel time $M > n$ to discourage their use. Assign time windows to all cities as $[0,K]$, with $K$ large enough so they do not constrain routing. Set the maximum allowed travel time $k = n$. Thus, a route of total travel time $≤ k$ exists if and only if there is a Hamiltonian cycle in the original graph $G$. This polynomial-time reduction shows that TSPTW is at least as hard as the Hamiltonian Cycle problem, proving TSPTW is NP-hard.\n",
