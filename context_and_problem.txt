# Recontextualization of the Context and Problem

## ADEME Context and Challenges

ADEME (French Environment and Energy Management Agency) has launched a call for expressions of interest to promote
the execution of demos and experiments of new mobility solutions for people and goods, adapted to different territories.
This initiative is part of France's environmental commitments, including a 75% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.

### Challenges

The transportation and logistics sector represents the major contribution to carbon emissions and energy consumption.
Traditional delivery methods often lead to inefficient route planning resulting in excessive fuel consumption,
an increase in greenhouse gas emissions due to redundant trips, and poor resource optimization on deliveries.

### Challenges

There are new transport technologies, although more cost-effective and more environmentally friendly.
The optimization of resource management across multiple delivery points, real-time traffic adaptation and route recalculation,
and the coordination of multiple vehicles and time-sensitive deliveries. These logistics issues have applications in many areas such as
mail distribution, product delivery, road network maintenance and waste collection. The environmental impact of optimizing
these operations can be truly significant on a global scale.

## The Chosen Problem

CesiCDP has focused its study on delivery route optimization.
The challenge is to calculate on a road network an optimal route that allows connecting a subset of cities by visiting selected delivery points,
returning to the starting point ensuring a complete tour, and minimizing the total duration of the trip taking into account the expected traffic on each axis for different
time slots.

This problem, known as the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP), extends the classic Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) to integrate
realistic operational constraints. Among these constraints, we find in particular the management of several delivery vehicles operating simultaneously,
taking into account time windows for deliveries, and the integration of variable traffic conditions affecting travel times. The basic version aims
to develop a Python model capable of solving large-scale instances involving several cities.
